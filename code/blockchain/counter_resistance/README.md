# AMR Data Collection Ecosystem: Smart Contract Specification (Draft)

## Overview
This document briefly outlines the smart contract specifications for the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Data Collection Ecosystem. The ecosystem leverages blockchain technology to incentivize the submission, validation, and funding of AMR-related datasets, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency throughout the process.

## Core Contracts

### DatasetRegistry Contract
- **Objective:** Manages AMR dataset registrations as ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including tracking and versioning.
- **Key Features:**
  - Minting NFTs for each dataset submission.
  - Implementing version control via metadata.
  - Ensuring ERC-721 compliance.

### Validation Contract
- **Objective:** Oversees the validation of datasets against established quality and relevance standards.
- **Key Features:**
  - Tracking validation status of each dataset.
  - Interacting with the DatasetRegistry for status updates.

## Funding Infrastructure

### BaseFundingContract
- **Objective:** Offers foundational fund management functionalities.
- **Key Features:**
  - Supports fund depositing and withdrawing.
  - Handles transactions using ERC-20 tokens.

### Specialized Funding Channel Contracts
- **Variants:** General, Data Collection & Submission, Data Validation & Quality Assurance, R&D, Education & Outreach, Emergency Response, and Developer Support.
- **Objective:** Tailors funding mechanisms to specific ecosystem needs.
- **Key Features:**
  - Provides incentives for dataset submission and validation.
  - Supports R&D, education, emergency responses, and development.

## Reputation System

### Reputation Contract
- **Objective:** Manages reputation tokens to reflect ecosystem contributions.
- **Key Features:**
  - Utilizes ERC-1155 for a flexible, multi-token standard.
  - Tracks and issues reputation tokens based on activities.

This draft summarizes the core components of the AMR Data Collection Ecosystem's smart contract architecture, foundational to enhancing global health security against antimicrobial resistance.
