[TOC]

# What is AMR

<font style="color: darkred;">Antimicrobial resistance</font> (AMR) means bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve resistance to the medications intended to kill or curb their growth. This leaves standard treatments ineffective, resulting in persistent and potentially lethal infections with a heightened risk of spreading to others. While AMR is a natural phenomenon, it is accelerated by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals, and agriculture, positioning it as a critical global public health challenge, both now and for the foreseeable future.


# Our Mission

Our mission is to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance by fostering a unified global network that prioritizes data exchange, predictive analytics, and collaborative action. 
To empower every corner of the globe, from well-resourced institutions to those in the most resource-limited settings, with the tools and insights needed to collect, predict, prevent, and counteract AMR. Through innovation, transparency, and shared responsibility, we are dedicated to safeguarding public health and ensuring a future where antibiotics remain effective.


# Our Vision for the AMR Platform

We wish to address AMR by harnessing global data to enable analytics, research, inform policy, and guide clinical decisions. 

- **Global collaboration**: Recognizing that AMR is a global challenge, we enable the collection of datasets from across the world, making them accessible in one location for comprehensive analysis and action.
- **Data-driven decisions**: By aggregating extensive AMR data, we empower healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers with the information needed to make informed decisions that improve health outcomes and optimize antibiotic use.
