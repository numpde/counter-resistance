# Counter-Resistance

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a global threat requiring collective action by creating a secure, transparent data-sharing platform and leveraging analytics to forecast and respond to AMR threats. Recognizing the interdependence of global health systems, we aim to create incentives for wealthier institutions to support those with fewer resources, ensuring the collective good is served through comprehensive AMR surveillance and response.

## Mission

To combat the rising threat of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) by fostering a unified global network that prioritizes secure data exchange, predictive analytics, and collaborative action. Our mission is to empower every corner of the globe, from well-resourced institutions to those in the most resource-limited settings, with the tools and insights needed to collect, predict, prevent, and counteract AMR. Through innovation, transparency, and shared responsibility, we are dedicated to safeguarding public health and ensuring a future where antibiotics remain effective.
